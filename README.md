# Roman-Urdu-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Transformers-and-Ensemble-Models

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis framework for Roman Urdu social media text using advanced transformer models (XLM-T, DistilBERT) and ensemble techniques (weighted voting and meta-classifier stacking). It includes:

Dataset: 11,000 manually annotated Roman Urdu reviews (positive/negative).

Code: Preprocessing pipeline, transformer fine-tuning, and ensemble model training using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

Results: Achieved 84.71% F1-score using an XLM-T + DistilBERT stacking ensemble.

Notebook: End-to-end implementation with evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and interactive sentiment prediction.
